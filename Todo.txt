idea from extension web develper, resize to different resolution


check how long a popup stays round for()eg fire an event which the popup subscribes to and it adds one to a pgpage 

could be hardcore and raise an event that will be fired from the backround page, and the options page could pick it up.. if possible
options button in popup
make "image cache cleared be a message box up the top" like remeber password or the popup tips
can you pass the options page variables(e.g the current websites favicon)

mycroft link could include a link to seach the current domain (as well as a direct link)
could use the star icon in <li>'s


some light gradients in the pop background... horz or vertical


choose default search/last search engine/current site
options link

flex you description features inoption and wave
double click edit?

bug: try to add a homepage should capture  
font text/ message background
icons for website added/error/ addwebsite/info
look at the chrome upload throbber

train search use the paez favicon link (and open if not included) 
research google analytics

improve logging messages
the overrun of text



add fade in and outs to notifactions

updates features in popup (not what's new) (not that great an idea, may just a new version popup)

either highlight or move into own window

*********problems with engine layout******


there is definately an issue where the searchurl could be malformed eg null and then we can't delete it; need to move away from this as the primary key

lower case the engine object properties

could put opensearch xml address in the engine property, would need a local address for default engines, what should we do with trained/manual engines 

needs a unique guid to store ID: something like func getguid(){make up one, is it in use? return}

******************************************


could make the throbber display in canvas and rotate


some sort of update box to notify when new versions go live
an error report send to me, should also collect the console .log

search this site:either uses open query or a google search to search the current domian

move popup js code into it's own file

tips bar to help with the learning

get selectiong ignores cross domain security errors 

"make descriptions better"

iframes in wave?

How expenisve is a javascript exeception
The current implementation of inject script is pretty crazy with all-frames seam inconsistant
is it true that it work for iframes that are of different domians? if so it should be labeled that way in the documentation

search: if home page is open overwrite it, rather than new tab

3.2
can you listen for cntl and c for copying


3.4
set default engine/last engine/current site

3.5
simple search codes keys... eg /w for wikipedia (this could actually to in the text eg avatar /i /p will search imdb & piratebay)

3.6
right click is multi search

3.7 search hot keys(not bring up browser action)
ctrl + w will search wikipeida

3.8 hot which open the seach engine list in anew page?

4.9 engine feed (like rss), when load the page, grabs engine feeds whihc can have engines & engines lists,lots to think about this
how does do you upload (google docs?), is it readonly?, what happens when you delete engines, a readonly list may be easiest


look into attaching objects to elements http://www.robertnyman.com/javascript/javascript-getters-setters.html

use three column layout

for things like check boxes can we set up some sort of bind?


do we even need to store last search what is the point!?

make more consistant with default home page (view source)

on blank seach goes straight to the domain

draggable options
double click edit

how about a extensionthat converts time to you current location

pressing the up arrow cycles through history

shortcut Key to bring up browser action

google suggest

multiple opens

learn about queryselectorAll , get elements by css selector

improve orange to a gradient

three column
can you paste?
google suggest (plus look into open query) plus more history
the first three are always history and the next three can be suggest 
[last]
[search]
[completed]
current text or selected text
[sggestion 1 if exists]
[suggestion2 if exists]
[suggestion4 if exists]]


something that makes debugging easier
could log plus generate html so we don't need to go to the backgound page all the time

create engine managment page


restart the todo

rename //todo to //enhance //bugg 


*radio button for defult/last/select engine 
then a drop down for the selected engine
